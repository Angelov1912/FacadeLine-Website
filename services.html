                                        for a number purposes. For example:<br>Cladding can create a controlled internal environment or an external
                                        façade, often for aesthetic purposes. It can create a weather tight building envelope and prevent the spread of fire.
                                        It is also used to provide privacy and security, allow secure access and increase energy efficiency.
                                        Of course cladding also allows for ventilation and penetration of daylight.

                                    <h2>Curtain Walling</h2>
                                        <p>A curtain wall system is an outer covering ofa building in which the outer walls are non-structural,
                                            but merely keep the waterout and the occupants in. As the curtain wall is non-structural it can be made
                                            of a lightweight material, reducing construction costs. When glass is used as a curtain wall,
                                            a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall facade
                                            does not carry any dead load weight from the building other than its own. The wall transfers horizontal wind
                                            loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure trough connections at floors or columns of the building.
                                            A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and seismic activites acting
                                            on the building, and its own dead load weight.

                                        Rooflights (sometimes described as ‘roof lights’ or ‘skylights’) are windows built into the roof of a building.
                                        They are effective at allowing natural light deep into the centre of a building, particularly where it is not possible to install windows in perimeter walls or where privacy is needed.
                                        Where they are openable, they can also be effective at promoting natural ventilation, as they tend to be at the top of buildings and so can benefit from the stack effect.
                                        They may also be used to allow access to roofs or to roof terraces.
